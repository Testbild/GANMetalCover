# Resources

The data folder contains the link to the kaggle.com dataset that has been used. As it is several GB large it cannot be uploaded to github.

The saved_models folder contains models for 28x28 and 64x64 pixel images. For 128x128 the calculation power was not big enough, hence there is no pretrained model here, sorry!

The results folder shows some real and fake images from the models. If a picture is not explicitly marked with "real" in the name it is generated by the network (or we made a mistake while labeling, that is also possible).
