The data folder contains the link to the kaggle.com dataset that has been used. As it is several GB large it cannot be uploaded to github.

The results folder contains models for 28x28 and 64x64 pixel images. For 128x128 the calculation power was not big enough, hence there is no pretrained model here, sorry!
